          Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should
          start learning after HTML. While HTML is used to define the structure
          and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out.
          For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and
          spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add
          animations and other decorative features.

          You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We
          recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first.
          Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you
          learn further HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth
          between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting
          and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really
          learn CSS without knowing HTML. Before starting this topic, you should
          also be familiar with the following: 
          <ul>
            <li>using computers and using the web passively
            (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content).
            </li> 
            <li>You should have a
            basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software
            and understand how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing
            with files — both of which are parts of our Getting started with the
            web complete beginner's module.
            </li> 
            <li>It is also recommended that you work
            through Getting started with the web before proceeding with this
            topic, especially if you are completely new to web development.
            </li>
        </ul>
          However, much of what is covered in its CSS basics article is also
          covered in our CSS first steps module, albeit in a lot more detail.

            This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for
            working through them. You should definitely start with the first one.
            </p>

        <h3>CSS first steps</h3> 
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay
            out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and
            spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add
            animations and other decorative features. This module provides a
            gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of
            how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using
            it to add styling to HTML.
            </p>
        <h3>CSS building blocks</h3> 
            <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left
            off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax,
            and got some basic experience with using it, its time to dive a bit
            deeper. This module looks at the folowing: 
                <ul>
                    <li>cascade and inheritance</li>
                    <li>all the
                    selector types we have available </li> 
                    <li>units</li>
                    <li>sizing</li>
                    <li>styling backgrounds and borders</li>
                    <li>debugging</li>
                    <p>and lots more.</p>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent
            CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on
            to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.
            </p>
            
        <h3>Styling text</h3> 
            <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS
            topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most
            common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling
            fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, italics, line and
            letter spacing, drop shadows and other text features. We round off the
            module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling
            lists and links.
            </p>
                <p>
                <h3>Fonts</h3>
                <p>Let's move straight on to look at properties for styling fonts. In this example we'll apply some different CSS properties to the same HTML sample, which looks like this:
                <pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;Tommy the cat&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat
had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
predator — Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
occasion such as this that he did.&lt;/p&gt;
                </code>
                </pre>
                </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Font weight</h3>
                    <p>
                        Font weight referes to the thickness of the lettering. The hight the weight, the more bold the text. 
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
    p { 
        font-weight: 500;
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>Font size</h3>
                    <p>
                        This one should be fairly self explainitory. The font size property adjusts the font to the selected size. for example:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
    p {
    font-size: 15px;
    }
    /* Font size can also be set to rem, %, px and many more*/
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>Color</h3>
                    <p>The color property sets the color of the foreground content of the selected elements (which is usually the text, but can also include a couple of other things, such as an underline or overline placed on text using the text-decoration property).</p>

                    <p>color can accept any CSS color unit, for example:</p>
                <pre>    
                    <code>
    p {
        color: red;
        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The background-color property sets the color of the background.
                background-color can accept any CSS color unit, for example:</p>
                <pre>    
                    <code>
    p {
        background-color: red;
        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                </p>
        
        <h3>CSS layout</h3> 
            <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how
            to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your
            content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes
            in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We
            have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into
            CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools
            like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy
            techniques you might still want to know about.
            </p>

          Use CSS to solve common problems provides links to sections of content
          explaining how to use CSS to solve very common problems when creating
          a web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the beginning, you'll primarily apply colors to HTML elements and
          their backgrounds; change the size, shape, and position of elements;
          and add and define borders on elements. But there's not much you can't
          do once you have a solid understanding of even the basics of CSS. One
          of the best things about learning CSS is that once you know the
          fundamentals, usually you have a pretty good feel for what can and
          can't be done, even if you don't actually know how to do it yet!
